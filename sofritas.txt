Prep Time 10 minutes
Cook Time 20 minutes

Ingredients

1 lbs Tofu (I have used Super Firm Organic Tofu)
1/4 Cup Chipotle in Adobo
1 Poblano Pepper (fire roasted, skin and seeds removed)
1 Garlic (1 clove of garlic)
1 tsp Oregano (preferably Mexican Oregano)
1 tsp Cumin Powder (roasted cumin powder)
1 tsp Salt
1 tsp Tajin Seasoning
3 tbsp Olive Oil


Directions

1. Sofrito Spice Blend ­ In a blender or hand blender's jar, add 1/4 cup Chipotle in Adobo sauce. Add roasted poblano peppers,
oregano, salt, garlic, roasted cumin powder, Tajin Seasoning, sugar(if using or if making first time at home, then recommended)
and 2 tbsp oil. Blend it using hand blender or in a food processor to make paste. Set aside.
2. Pat dry tofu to dry out extra moisture. Slice Tofu into 1/2 inch thick slices.
3. Heat 1/2 tbsp oil in a pan and pan fry tofu 2 to 3 pieces at a time ( depending upon how wide pan you have, make sure not to
overcrowd the pan. tofu should touch the hot pan surface all time) This takes about 3­4 minutes per side.
4. While you fry all pieces, drain fried tofu on a plate lined with clean paper towel to absorb out extra oil.
5. Chop or shred (with clean hands) the fried tofu into small bite size chunks. I kept it very chunkier this time, you can also chop it
roughly to very small pieces like Chipotle Mexican Grill.
6. In a pan, add 2­3 tbsp chipotle & poblano spice blend and fried shredded tofu. Also add 1/2 cup water and bring to boil.
7. Cover the pan and simmer for 10 minutes, till water has almost all evaporated and shredded tofu has been coated nicely in
Chipotle Sofrito.
